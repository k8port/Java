Java
====

Projects in Java. This repository contains various Java coding exercises I have completed for practice, homework, 
projects and/or to demonstrate ability.

In order to run code you must copy and paste into a text editor or IDE. 

If you copy code into a text editor, from the command line change directory until you are where you saved the code file.
Enter:  javac nameoffile.java.  This will compile the code into a .class file that can be run.  Enter java nameoffileâ€¦

If you copy code into an IDE such as Eclipse or Netbeans, please follow the instructions of the IDE.
